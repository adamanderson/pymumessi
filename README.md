# pymumessi

## Introduction
Pymumessi is the Python control software for the TES microwave-multiplexing flavor of the fMESSI readout electronics built by Fermilab. Low-level code is borrowed heavily from the MkidDigitalReadout package, while the overall design is loosely inspired by pydfmux but lighter-weight and faster.
